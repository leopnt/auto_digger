# Auto Digger

Automatically find niche music using raw audio data

## Why?

DJs spend a significant amount of time looking for music that
- they can mix together with their current library
- isn't too popular

This process usually involves the following steps:
1. have an idea of what you are looking for
2. listen/browse discogs, youtube, spotify, record shops, ...

Automating this process would be a huge gain of time (not possible for the record shops yet though 💿😁)

Fortunately, the discogs database is publicly available and we have an already existing personal database of niche music. This project was born soon after realizing that.

Main difficulty identified: subjectivity regarding music
