This folder aims at giving a proof that the recommendation algorithm works with only one track as an input using statistics.

To do that : one track is compared to multiple other tracks.
For each track, we hand label/rate the estimated similarity as a DJ. The question is : "Does these two tracks mix well together (1-5)?".

The objective is to see a significant correlation between predictions and the hand labels.

Notes :

- This is very experimental and subjective.
- The dataset may be highly biased due to the comparison to only one track.
